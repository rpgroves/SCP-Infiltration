  - It seems that the button inside this room will give you access to the rest of
    Entrance Zone Sector 1 to the east.
  - 'After that you''ll need to get to Sector 2 to the west. But due to a power failure
    in Sector 1, access is still cutoff to ourside sectors. '
  - You will need to find a way into the power station in this sector, then fix any
    broken generators you find.
  - Good luck, command out.
