10/27-10/29
	boss ideas: SCP 106
	-phase 1: 	
		-he tries to follow you around the welcome center
		-he creates decay zones on the ground that damage after X seconds 
		(think the hitscan from clash royale game)
		-he shoots bits of decay at the player
		(make decay zones on the ground after going x distance?)
	-phase 2:
		-when at half health, he takes you into his pocket dimension
		-he cannot take damage here
		-you must destroy 3 void hearts to escape and weaken him 
		(hollow knight reference lol)
		-same attacks? maybe add more moves for this phase
	-phase 3:
		-pity phase
		-boss follows player around very slowly, using weaker versions of prior attacks
		-when at 10% health, he stops and sits still
		player can keep damaging and it shows him slowly being destroyed by the final shots
