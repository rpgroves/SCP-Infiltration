  - Thank god you're here. I had started to lose hope anyone would show up for us.
  - Look, I need to stay here but I might be able to help you get out of here. Do
    you see that keypad next to the giant monitor?
  - That keypad will open the door to the welcome center to the north, but I'm definitely
    not following you there. The last thing I heard there was gunfire, and a lot
    of it.
  - I think the last group that went through here left a hint as to the code on the
    keypad, but I dont know the combination myself. Good luck.
