  - I know there wasnt enough time to teach you everything. But there is an urgent
    mission and only we are close enough to help.
  - In the past hour, The Foundation has reason to believe that Site 08 has had a
    catastrophic containment breach. We are not yet sure of the cause.
  - As a part of our unit and the only specialist within range of this facility,
    Im going to be sending you in as soon as we get there. But dont worry, I can
    help guide you once you are inside.
