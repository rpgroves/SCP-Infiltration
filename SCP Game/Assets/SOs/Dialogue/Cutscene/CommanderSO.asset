  - Welcome to the SCP Foundation soldier.
  - Weve chosen you because of your past military experience and your record as a
    reliable agent.
  - Incase you've forgotten, the Foundation specializes in Securing, Containing,
    and Protecting unusual or dangerous objects, creatures, and phenomena.
  - We call these things "anomalies." The Foundation studies them in order to understand
    and control them, as well as protect the general public.
  - As part of that mission, we make sure that the general public remains unaware
    of such dangerous anomalies.
  - You are joining us as part of an MTF unit, or Mobile Task Force. Our unit is
    Task Force Delta-4, Designated "The Minutemen".
  - We are a rapid response team that specializes in quickly deploying to and controling
    a scene. Our main tasks are assessing a situation and quelling a threat until
    backup can arrive.
  - As such we are always the first team to reach a scene, thus the designation "The
    Minutemen."
