  - It looks like you just fought the Chaos Insurgency! Theyre the Foundation's biggest
    enemy. Their presence here cant be good. Proceed with caution.
  - The sector has been put on lockdown it seems. You'll need to find a way out of
    that room and then find a way to lift the lockdown so backup can get to you.
  - There is a security booth at the back of that room, it should have a way to open
    up the exits from that room.
