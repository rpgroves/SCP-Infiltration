  - Welcome to Site-08 Agent. Youll need to proceed through this checkpoint into
    the welcome center. We're pulling up blueprints to the facility and it seems
    you should be able to take a back entrance into the security station to the east.
  - From there, you need to proceed north to the welcome center. Good luck, command
    out.
