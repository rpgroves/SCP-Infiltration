  - Hello? Hello, hello? Uh, I wanted to record a message for you to help you get
    settled in on your first night.
  - Um, I actually worked in that office before you. I'm finishing up my last week
    now, as a matter of fact.
  - So, I know it can be a bit overwhelming, but I'm here to tell you there's nothing
    to worry about. Uh, you'll do fine. So, let's just focus on getting you through
    your first week. Okay?
